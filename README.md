# NewlibMarkup2SphinxConverter
This repo contains code for NewlibMarkup2SphinxConverter.

Introduction: RTEMS uses the Newlib C Library for a significant portion of its POSIX support. Currently, the RTEMS POSIX Users Guide will not provide documentation for a method not based on Newlib's. Therefore, this project aims to automatically convert Newlib markup to Sphinx output and integrate with POSIX users guide.
